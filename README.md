Welcome to the official repository for the "Light Adaptation Clamp" tool, as described in our recent publication [link to the publication]. This repository hosts both the source code and the detailed mathematical formulations underlying the tool's functionality.

About the Light Adaptation Clamp Tool
The "Light Adaptation Clamp" is a sophisticated computational tool designed to model and analyze the dynamics of photoreceptor responses under various light conditions. Based on advanced biophysical principles, this tool allows researchers to simulate and understand the adaptation processes of photoreceptors in response to changing light stimuli.
